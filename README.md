## About Me

Hi, I’m Vibhav! I'm a fourth year Computer Science student at Georgia Tech. In this repository are projects which I have done in my free time. Outside of school and work, I enjoy watching and playing football and basketball, swimming, realistic fiction or historical fiction novels, cooking new things, and outdoor adventures. 

## My Interests

Some of my interests in software include developing data management and engineering software and building full-stack applications from data pipelines, specifically AI/ML algorithm-powered data pipelines.
